**Extracted info:**
- Red apple color largely comes from anthocyanin pigments that accumulate as fruit ripens and chlorophyll degrades.
- Pigment expression varies by cultivar and sunlight exposure.

**Extracted info:**
- Green apples appear green when chlorophyll is retained or degrades more slowly.
- Temperature and light affect pigment genes; bagging/shade reduces anthocyanin.
