## Final Context Snapshot
```
Red apple color largely comes from anthocyanin pigments that accumulate as fruit ripens and chlorophyll degrades.
Pigment expression varies by cultivar and sunlight exposure.
Green apples appear green when chlorophyll is retained or degrades more slowly.
Temperature and light affect pigment genes; bagging/shade reduces anthocyanin.
